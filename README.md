# NapoleonBotPy
A repository for the Development Version of NapoleonBot.py

NapoleonBot.py was a project started way back in 2019 for an old server of mine, it eventually got pretty far (I even attempted to add music support - failed terribely).
The main issue back then was long term support and hosting, as I planned to release the code for NapoleonBot and provide support for anyone attempting to use it,
it was also originally planned to be available to everyone. You can imagine 14 year old me having to juggle all of that, so the project stagnated.

That was, until I had aquired a Rasperry Pi, on which I could host NapoleonBot 24/7 while also focusing on development.
I am, however, notoriously bad at being consistent with projects of mine, and eventually NapoleonBot became ignored, just as most of my projects - though this time it was more due
to my lack of knowledge in python.

NapoleonBot was never consistently hosted through 2020, and it died early in the year.
However, it has always been in the back of my mind, how amazing it would be to have actually "completed" this project..
So.. Here, today, in 2021 I am resuming development for NapoleonBot.py. My Pi is currently missing the MSD card so I can't host it long term right now, but seeing as nobody knows
that it exists, that wont be a problem.

The original code for NapoleonBot sits on my dead laptop (dead in the sense I fucked up the ribbon cable to the power button and haven't fixed it since, bummer.).
The other version, which is a branch of the original code, sits on the MSD card somewhere - I'll find it eventually... I hope.
That means that this version of NapoleonBot is completely new and fresh, ripe for development.
